Why use NextJs on 2023 instead of react base. Well I think react is a great library but in the las 6 year I had found bad code with react since firts version,
so I am happy to know there are a framework who resolve some on the standars of web developemnet with react. Like Angular an Vue, examples of a robust frameworks
to build stands and clean code, so in the next post I will try to document all the best practices

### PNPM

Why use `pnpm` intead of `npm` or `yarn`. Because this save disk and has faster instalation, also we can use `microfrontends` with better handler

```bash
brew install pnpm
```

### Command

```bash
pnpm create next-app <app_name> --template typescript
```
